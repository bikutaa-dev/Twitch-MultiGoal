## Getting Started

- install Node [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- Once installed unzip the multigoal folder gotten from this page
  - go into the folder and click the file:

    `installer.bat` 


- When install is done you can close the CMD window, to start the program you can now click the file:

  `start.bat`

- From here you will get steps in the CMD window for setting up Multigoal
  - This window this needs to be remain open to have the multigoal script running.

If you want the Multigoal printed to the screen, use a text source and point it towards output.txt and it will be updated automatically. 
For the setting up part I'm doing very litle input checking so make sure you use the correct input type, as in when it says "numbers only"
only use 1-9. 

## Updating
  - unzip the multigoal folder gotten from this page
  
  - Copy over and replace the filesfrom this new folder to your old folder for the script.

  - As usual go into the folder and click:
  
    `start.bat`

    you will now be prompted with new settings option the first time.
